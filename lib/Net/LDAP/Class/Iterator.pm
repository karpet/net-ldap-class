=head1 NAME

Net::LDAP::Class::Iterator - iterate over Net::LDAP::Class objects

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 my $iterator = $user->groups_iterator;
 while ( my $group = $iterator->next ) {
    # $group isa Net::LDAP::Class::Group
 }
 printf("%d groups found\n", $iterator->count);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Net::LDAP::Class::Iterator handles paged searching using Net::LDAP::Control::Paged.

=head1 ITERATORS vs ARRAYS

Many of the relationship methods in Net::LDAP::Class get and set arrays
or array refs of related objects. For small (<1000) data sets arrays are just
fine but as data sets scale, different techniques become necessary. An iterator
has a big resource advantage over an array: instead of holding all the related
objects in memory at once, as an array does, an iterator reads one
object at a time from the LDAP server.

For example, if you want to look at all the users who are members of a group,
and the number of users is large (>1000), some LDAP servers (Active Directory
in particular) won't return all of your user objects in a single query. Instead,
the results must be paged using Net::LDAP::Control::Paged. You'll see the
evidence of this if you call the following code against Active Directory
with a group of more than 1000 users.

 my $group = MyADGroup->new( cn => 'myBigGroup', ldap => $ldap )->read;
 my $users = $group->users;  # bitten by AD! returns an empty array ref!
 foreach my $user (@$users) {
   # nothing here -- the array is empty
 }

The call to $group->users returns an empty array because Active Directory
refuses to return more than 1000 results at a time. (NOTE the number 1000
is the default maximum; your server may be configured differently.)

So an iterator to the rescue!

 my $users = $group->users_iterator;
 while ( my $user = $users->next ) {
    # do something with $user
 }
 printf("We saw %d users in group %s\n", $users->count, $group->name);

You might ask, why bother with arrays at all if iterators are so great.
The answer is convenience. 
For small data sets, arrays are convenient,
especially if you intend to do things with subsets of them at a time.
Of course, you could do this:

 my $users = $group->users_iterator;
 my @allusers;
 while ( my $user = $users->next ) {
     push @allusers, $user;
 }
 
But then you've negated one of the advantages of the iterator: it is
less resource-intensive. But hey, if you've got the memory, honey,
Perl's got the time.

=head2 count

Returns the number of iterations performed.

=cut

sub count {

Returns true (1) if all the results for this iterator have
been seen, false (0) otherwise.

=cut

}

=head2 next

Returns the next Net::LDAP::Class object from the pager. Returns
undef if no more results are found.

=head2 finish

Tell the server you're done iterating over results.
This method is only necessary if you stop before exhausting
all the results.

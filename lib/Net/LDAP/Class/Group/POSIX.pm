=head1 NAME

Net::LDAP::Class::Group::POSIX - group class for POSIX LDAP schema

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 # create a subclass for your local LDAP
 package MyLDAPGroup;
 use base qw( Net::LDAP::Class::Group::POSIX );
 
 __PACKAGE__->metadata->setup(
     base_dn             => 'dc=mycompany,dc=com',
    attributes          => __PACKAGE__->POSIX_attributes,
    unique_attributes   => __PACKAGE__->POSIX_unique_attributes,
 );

 # then use your class
 my $ldap = get_and_bind_LDAP_object(); # you write this
 
 use MyLDAPGroup;
 my $group = MyLDAPGroup->new( ldap => $ldap, cn   => 'foobar' );
 $group->read_or_create;

 }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Net::LDAP::Class::Group::POSIX isa Net::LDAP::Class::Group implementing
the POSIX LDAP schema.

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=head2 POSIX_attributes

Returns array ref of 'cn', 'gidNumber' and 'memberUid'.

=cut

sub POSIX_attributes {

    # these attributes refer to the posixGroup object
    # which SUPER::read() will refer to.
    return [
        qw(
            cn gidNumber memberUid
            )
    ];

}

=head2 POSIX_unique_attributes

Returns array ref of 'cn' and 'gidNumber'.

=cut

sub POSIX_unique_attributes {
    return [qw( cn gidNumber )];
}

=head1 OBJECT METHODS

=head2 read

Overrides (and calls) base method to perform additional sanity check
that the matching organizational unit exists for the primary posixGroup.

=cut

sub read {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->SUPER::read( base_dn => 'ou=Group,' . $self->base_dn, @_ )
        or return;

    my $name = $self->cn;

    # double check that organizational unit exists too
    if (!$self->find(
            base_dn => 'ou=People,' . $self->base_dn,
            scope   => 'sub',
            filter  => "(ou=$name)"
        )
        )
    {
        croak
            "fatal LDAP error: posixGroup $name found but no matching organizational unit";
    }

    return $self;
}

=head2 action_for_create([ cn => I<cn_value>, gidNumber => I<gid> ])

Add a group to the database.

May be called as a class method with explicit B<cn> and B<gidNumber>
key/value pairs.

=head2 action_for_update

Save new gidNumber (gid) or cn (name) for an existing group. 

B<NOTE:> Because of the POSIX schema layout, 
renaming a group means creating a new group, moving
existing users into it, and deleting the old group. This is handled
transparently in action_for_update().

=head2 fetch_primary_users

Required MethodMaker method for retrieving primary_users from LDAP.

Returns array or array ref based on context, of related User objects
who have this group assigned as their primary group.

=head2 primary_users_iterator

Returns Net::LDAP::Class::Iterator for the same query as fetch_primary_users().

See the advice in L<Net::LDAP::Class::Iterator> about iterators
versus arrays.

}

=head2 fetch_secondary_users

Required MethodMaker method for retrieving secondary_users from LDAP.

Returns array or array ref based on context, of related User objects
who have this group assigned as a secondary group.

Consider using secondary_users_iterator() instead, especially if you
have large groups. See L<Net::LDAP::Class::Iterator> for an explanation.
This method is just a wrapper around secondary_users_iterator().

    return wantarray ? @users : \@users;
}

=head2 secondary_users_iterator([I<opts>])

Returns Net::LDAP::Class::SimpleIterator for the same query as 
fetch_secondary_users().

See the advice in L<Net::LDAP::Class::Iterator> about iterators
versus arrays.

=cut

sub secondary_users_iterator {
    my $self       = shift;

            return $user_class->new( ldap => $ldap, uid => $uid )->read;
        }

}

=head2 gid

Alias for gidNumber() attribute.

=cut

sub gid {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->gidNumber(@_);
}

Net::LDAP::Class::Group::AD - Active Directory group class

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 # create a subclass for your local Active Directory
 package MyLDAPGroup;
 use base qw( Net::LDAP::Class::Group::AD );
 
 __PACKAGE__->metadata->setup(
    base_dn             => 'dc=mycompany,dc=com',
    attributes          => __PACKAGE__->AD_attributes,
    unique_attributes   => __PACKAGE__->AD_unique_attributes,
 );

 # then use your class
 my $ldap = get_and_bind_LDAP_object(); # you write this
 
 use MyLDAPGroup;
 my $group = MyLDAPGroup->new( ldap => $ldap, cn => 'foobar' );
 $group->read_or_create;

 while ( my $user = $users->next ) {
     printf("user %s in group %s\n", $user, $group);
 }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Net::LDAP::Class::Group::AD isa Net::LDAP::Class::Group implementing
the Active Directory LDAP schema.

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=head2 AD_attributes

Returns array ref of a subset of the default Active Directory
attributes. Only a subset is used since the default schema contains
literally 100s of attributes. The subset was chosen based on its
similarity to the POSIX schema.

=cut

sub AD_attributes {
    [   qw(
            canonicalName
            cn
            description
            distinguishedName
            info
            member
            primaryGroupToken
            whenChanged
            whenCreated
            objectClass
            objectSID
            )
    ];
}

=head2 AD_unique_attributes

Returns array ref of unique Active Directory attributes.

=cut

sub AD_unique_attributes {
    [qw( cn objectSID distinguishedName )];
}

=head1 OBJECT METHODS

=head2 fetch_primary_users

Required MethodMaker method for retrieving primary_users from LDAP.

Returns array or array ref based on context, of related User objects
who have this group assigned as their primary group.

=cut

sub fetch_primary_users {
    my $self       = shift;
    my $user_class = $self->user_class;
    my $pgt        = $self->primaryGroupToken;
    my @users      = $user_class->find(
        scope   => 'sub',
        filter  => "(primaryGroupID=$pgt)",
        ldap    => $self->ldap,
        base_dn => $self->base_dn,
    );

    return wantarray ? @users : \@users;
}

=head2 primary_users_iterator([I<opts>])

Returns a Net::LDAP::Class::Iterator object for all the related
primary users for the group.

This is the same data as primary_users() returns, but is more
efficient since it pages the results and only fetches
one at a time.

=cut

sub primary_users_iterator {
    my $self = shift;
    my $user_class = $self->user_class or croak "user_class required";
    my $pgt = $self->primaryGroupToken || $self->read->primaryGroupToken;
    return Net::LDAP::Class::Iterator->new(
        class   => $user_class,
        ldap    => $self->ldap,
        base_dn => $self->base_dn,
        filter  => "(primaryGroupID=$pgt)",
        @_
    );
}

=head2 fetch_secondary_users

Required MethodMaker method for retrieving secondary_users from LDAP.

Returns array or array ref based on context, of related User objects
who have this group assigned as a secondary group (memberOf).

Consider using secondary_users_iterator() instead, especially if you
have large groups. See L<Net::LDAP::Class::Iterator> for an explanation.
This method is just a wrapper around secondary_users_iterator().

=cut

# changed to using iterator to avoid surprises for large groups.
sub fetch_secondary_users {
    my $self = shift;
    my @users;
    my $iter = $self->secondary_users_iterator;
    while ( my $u = $iter->next ) {
        push @users, $u;
    }
    return wantarray ? @users : \@users;
}

=head2 secondary_users_iterator([I<opts>])

Like primary_users_iterator, only for secondary_users.

This is the same data as secondary_users() returns, but is more
efficient since it pages the results and only fetches
one at a time.

=cut

sub secondary_users_iterator {
    my $self = shift;
    my $dn = $self->distinguishedName || $self->cn;

    # escape any parens
    $dn =~ s/\(/\\(/g;
    $dn =~ s/\)/\\)/g;

    # there's a subtle bug possible here.
    # unlike secondary_users, which will croak if there's
    # a mismatch in the list of members the group claims
    # and what LDAP actually returns for the $dn value,
    # this query will silenty miss any users who don't have
    # memberOf set correctly. I don't *think* it's an issue
    # since we're looking for memberOf specifically,
    # rather than parsing the $dn for the user's distinguishedName
    # but you never know.
    # The behaviour in secondary_users() is actually more brittle,
    # as it will point out the problems in parsing the $dn.
    return Net::LDAP::Class::Iterator->new(
        class   => $self->user_class,
        ldap    => $self->ldap,
        base_dn => $self->base_dn,
        filter  => qq{(memberOf=$dn)},
        @_
    );
}

=head2 gid

Alias for calling primaryGroupToken() method.
Note that primaryGroupToken is dynamically generated 
by the server and cannot be assigned (set).

=cut

sub gid { shift->primaryGroupToken }

=head2 action_for_create([ cn => I<cn_value> ])

Add a group to the database.

May be called as a class method with explicit B<cn> key/value pair.

=cut

sub action_for_create {
    my $self = shift;
    my %opts = @_;
    my $name = delete $opts{cn} || $self->cn
        or croak "cn required to create()";

    my @actions = (
        add => [
            {   dn   => "CN=$name," . $self->base_dn,
                attr => [
                    objectClass => [ 'top', 'group' ],
                    cn          => $name,
                ],
            },
        ]
    );

    return @actions;

}

=head2 action_for_update

Save new cn (name) for an existing group.

=cut

    my $self = shift;
    my %opts = @_;

    my $base_dn = delete $opts{base_dn} || $self->base_dn;
